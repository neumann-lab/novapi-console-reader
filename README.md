### Instructions
- **USE A USB CABLE**, we haven't tried it with a bluetooth dongle. So while we are experimenting with the bluetooth dongle, please use the USB cable.
- Run the main.py
- Input the correct port which you have your usb connected to
- You are done!
### Common problems
#### I can't upload via the usb cable! / The terminal can't run while I am uploading with the usb cable.
- Please disconnect the USB cable first before using this file or upload the file first as when this file is ran, the port will be busy making it unable to be used with other programs such as mBlock.
